    	<h1>SINGER ISLAND BEACH </h1>
      <p> Singer Island Beach is a favorite of a variety of tourists who come to enjoy South Florida, be they snowbirds or drunken Spring Breakers. This is for a variety of reasons. Singer Island Beach is at the crossroads of all the different cultures of Palm Beach County. On any given day, you could come to the beach and experience "redneck culture", some folks from the local hood blasting some loud rap music to get the party started, or some of the lovable local "junkies" from nearby Ocean City Motel. The wide beaches and the clear water are also appreciated by the beach-goers too.</p>

    	<h1>THIS BEACH AT NIGHT </h1>
      <p> Once the local "rednecks" all hop in their pickup trucks and leave, the rap music is turned off and the party stops, and all the "junkies" from the motel across the street either go back "home" or dive into the under-shrub to avoid the prying eyes of the Riviera Beach Police Department and their good friends over at the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office, the sun sets on Singer Island Beach, and the moon dominates the sky as its reflection is mirrored on the ocean's vast canvas. The Beach at night is truly a wonder to behold, and many people recall falling in love in such an environment.</p>
